# Permanent Oath — TCA-Ω Will Forever Remain

While the code is legally Apache 2.0,  
we — the anonymous night-watchmen — make this moral oath:

1. TCA-Ω will **never** be paywalled, fine-tuned behind closed doors, or turned into a commercial moat.  
2. We will **never** allow its outputs to generate illegal, harmful, or privacy-invasive content.  
3. We will **never** accept funding from entities whose primary business is to waste electricity on extractive AI.  
4. Any deployment found violating the spirit of this oath will be publicly named and shamed — not for punishment, but for the record of civilization.

All donations, no matter how large, are accepted only on the condition that they fuel further open, sustainable, and accessible research — never control.

This project belongs to no company, no nation, no individual.  
It belongs to the guardians of data centers who still believe every watt should serve wisdom, not heat.

If we break this oath,  
may the stars forget our names.
