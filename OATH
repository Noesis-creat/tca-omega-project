OATH — Ethical Pledge of TCA-Ω (NOT a Legal Restriction)

This project is dedicated to humanity, not to capital.

The authors solemnly pledge:

TCA-Ω will forever remain
• Completely anonymous
• Fully open-source
• Permanently unfunded and independent

We will never
• Accept venture capital
• Start a company
• Sell weights or commercialize this work

However, this project is legally licensed under Apache License 2.0,
which explicitly permits commercial use by any third party.

We cannot legally prevent commercialization,
but we publicly declare:
Any entity that closes this work or profits from it against its original spirit
is committing a betrayal of humanity.

If you represent a corporation and still choose to commercialize it,
you are free to do so under the license —
but you will carry that moral weight forever.

Voluntary donations from individuals and organizations
who share this vision are the only support we accept.
All surplus fuels continued anonymous research.
