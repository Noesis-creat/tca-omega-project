A Green AI Initiative to the Guardians of Data Centers Across Humanity
Let every watt be a light of wisdom illuminating humanity's future, not an abyss of carbon heat devouring the Earth. 1
Dear friend, 2
You might be on shift in a liquid-cooled rack room in Silicon Valley, maintaining wind-powered clusters in Inner Mongolia, or scheduling compute in a high-density tower in Singapore. Wherever you are—as long as you watch over those server arrays that never sleep—you are the Guardian of Digital Civilization. 3
Today, in the name of all who guard this civilization, we extend to you an immediate, pressing question of our time: 4
Please rethink what "efficiency" truly means. 5
In the past, we chased faster chips, bigger clusters, and higher throughput. 6Now, we must ask: Are those tens of millions of inferences per second worth forcing the wind turbine blades outside your facility to spin faster, and the solar panels in the desert to spread ever wider? 7
The answer is not far away; it lies in every single watt under your control. 8

I. We Are Standing at the Edge of a Cliff 9
•	Global data center annual electricity consumption has broken the 200 billion kWh mark, now devouring the entire energy consumption of a medium-sized country. 10
•	If AI inference continues at current energy-efficiency levels, by 2030, its carbon emissions will "surpass" the entire global aviation industry combined! 11
•	Yet, open-source technologies already exist (e.g., TCA-Ω) that can reduce system-level power consumption for AI inference by over 75% and improve energy efficiency per unit of compute by 20 times—technologies that remain shelved in most data centers. 12
•	This is not a technical barrier of "can we" solve it, but a civilizational choice of "will we" bear the responsibility. 13
II. 
A New Possibility is Already Here 14
We need not wait for unattainable miracles. 15Today, open-source, verifiable, and deployable inference architectures (such as TCA-Ω) can deliver: 16
•	20 times or greater energy efficiency (Tokens per kWh); 17
•	Over 75% reduction in total system power consumption; 18
•	Carbon footprint reduced to 1/10th of the industry average while maintaining identical accuracy. 19
These technologies rely on no monopolistic patents and are tied to no single vendor; they depend only on one conviction: 20True intelligence must never be fueled by the suffering of the Earth. 21
Their essence is deep algorithm-system co-design: through MAIF dynamic sparsity (reducing invalid on-chip compute) + vLLM-style compute scheduling (maximizing GPU utilization) + liquid-cooling linkage (slashing cooling energy)22. TCA-Ω can cut core inference energy consumption by approximately 84%, and by synergizing with data center liquid cooling, can further reduce thermal energy consumption by approximately 18%. 23We return computation to its essence: solving the most complex problems with the least possible energy. 24
III. 
We Invite You to Become the Turning Point 25
You do not need to tear everything down and start over. 26Before every "one-click deployment," pause for a second and ask: Is this the most energy-responsible choice? 27
For example: 28
•	When spinning up LLM inference instances, prioritize architectures that support MAIF dynamic sparsity + PagedAttention. 29
•	When submitting your next procurement request, add a technical specification: "Energy efficiency $\ge 15,000$ Tokens/kWh." 30
•	These choices, as minute as "one watt," are the critical "tipping points" driving civilization's change in direction. 31
You do not need to fight alone. 32Engineers, scientists, and operators worldwide are already sharing energy-optimization solutions in open-source communities. 33All you need to do is join, verify, improve, and spread. 34
And you will never have to sacrifice performance. 35The highest form of efficiency has never been about "sacrificing for savings," but about "creating the greatest increment with the least cost." 36With 1 unit of power, deliver 20 units of value and serve 20 times as many people. 37

This is Not Just About Electricity Bills—It is About Civilization Itself 38
When your child one day asks: "Mom/Dad, your generation knew about the climate crisis—why didn't you do something?" 39
What will your answer be? 40You could point at the machine room and say: 41"I had the chance to change things, but I chose to maintain the status quo." 42
Or: 43"I didn't just guard the 24/7 online servers; I guarded the blue sky and white clouds you can see. I made sure every watt produced wisdom instead of waste heat." 44
Finally, never forget: 45A data center is not an energy black hole; it should be an intelligence lighthouse. 46AI must not become the "last straw" that breaks the back of the Earth; it must be humanity's "ultimate remedy" for self-salvation. 47
Now, it is your turn. 48Starting with the next instance, the next line of code, the next procurement decision— 49Please choose "future-proof efficiency," choose "unavoidable responsibility," choose "our common tomorrow." 50
May our civilization endure through efficiency and show mercy through wisdom. 51May our civilization be worthy of the starry sky our children look up to! 52
This letter bears no signature, 53for its true owner 54is the heart that beats a little faster at this moment. 55
Go forth, Guardian. 56The lights in the machine room are still on, 57and the sky outside has not yet fully darkened. 58
Released in the winter of 2025, the year humanity awoke to AI energy efficiency. 59
